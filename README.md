# Booty Quest
 A demo game using Unity3D, a pirate game where player drives its pirate ship to rob loots from merchent ship and challenge the british navy ships.

Parts done by me:

- All UI related stuff, including HUD, Minimap, Instruction panel, Ship health wheel, all the different UI panels, etc.

- Language localization feature where player can switch game language between English and Chinese in game settings.

- All pirate island NPCs and the NPC services including banking, ship repair, ship upgrade and trade.

- Some gameplay stuff, Health Component, Language Switching Component etc.
